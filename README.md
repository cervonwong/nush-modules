NUSH Modules is a web app to help you explore the modules offered by NUS High School of Math and Science (NUS High)!

This service is not affiliated with NUS High School.

## About NUSH Modules

#### For students
NUSH Modules helps NUS High students make informed choices about the modules they will be taking. This includes viewing majoring options, forecasting their future workload in hours, and visualising prerequisite/corequisite graphs.

#### For parents
NUSH Modules helps parents understand the NUS High module system, including enrichment, elective, and core modules, as well as NUS High's specialisation and honours module system.

#### For incoming students
NUSH Modules helps incoming Primary 6 students explore the range of modules offered in NUS High. The interactive interface lays out how Da Vinci modules and research opportunities are incorporated into NUS High's module system.

## Motivation

We realised that the NUS High's website only displays the subjects taught, but do not go in depth into the modules offered. The only way to understand the modules offered is by viewing the 98-paged Programme of Studies PDF, which most students and parents do not read because they do not know it exists or simply because it is too lengthy. Developing an accessible service to explore the modules offered increases the awareness of the modules offered in NUS High.
