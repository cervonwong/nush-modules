NUSH Modules is a web app to help you explore the modules offered by NUS High School of Math and Science (NUSHS)!

This service is not affiliated with NUS High School.

## Mission

NUSH Modules helps NUSHS students make informed choices about the modules they will be taking. This includes viewing majoring options, forecasting their future workload in hours, and visualising prerequisite/corequisite graphs. Students will also get to explore the range of modules offered in NUSHS using the interactive interface. Students can easily get an overview of the specialisation and honours module system, including the possible combinations, tracks, and paths.

## Motivation

We realised that the NUSHS's website only displays the subjects taught, but do not go in depth into the modules offered. The only way to understand the modules offered is by viewing the 98-paged Programme of Studies PDF, which most students and parents do not read because they do not know it exists or simply because it is too lengthy. Developing an accessible service to explore the modules offered increases the awareness of the modules offered in NUSHS.
